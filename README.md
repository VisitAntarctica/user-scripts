User scripts to make the internet work better

## Purpose
Mainain user scripts for non-mainstream websites â€“ while big websites are well-covered by other tools, user scripts, add-ons, plugins, etc., less mainstream and adult sites are often maintained by smaller teams with fewer people to maintain and innovate their sites and as a result, are less "engineered" and often feature-deficient. 

These user scripts are thoughtfully designed to augment the user experience on these sites.
